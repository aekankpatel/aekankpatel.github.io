    long: `Built an end-to-end automated exploratory data analysis platform that profiles datasets, detects anomalies, scores ML readiness, and generates LLM-powered insights through a modular agentic pipeline.

What I Built:
• Architected InsightForge AI, a full-stack Auto-EDA system with 8 independent Python modules covering data profiling, anomaly detection, correlation analysis, feature summarization, health scoring, data cleaning, ML readiness evaluation, and LLM insight generation.
• Designed a single-API-call optimization for Groq-hosted LLaMA 3.1 that generates all three insight sections (overview, anomalies, correlations) in one request to stay within free-tier rate limits.
• Built 10 synthetic sample datasets (Titanic, Credit Card Fraud, Diabetes, Stock Market, etc.) with realistic distributions, class imbalance, and missing value patterns for out-of-the-box demos.

System Design:
• Implemented secure server-side API key management with a priority resolution chain: Streamlit Secrets → environment variable → fallback UI input, preventing key exposure in browser DevTools.
• Engineered a session state architecture to persist analysis results, chat history, cleaning state, and dataset history across Streamlit reruns without database dependencies.
• Computed a 5-dimension Dataset Health Scorecard (Completeness, Consistency, Outlier Health, Feature Quality, Correlation Structure) with programmatic scoring and letter grades.

Frontend & Analytics:
• Built 12-tab Streamlit dashboard with Plotly visualizations including correlation heatmaps, network graphs, outlier boxplot grids, sunburst feature breakdowns, and before/after cleaning comparisons.
• Shipped a natural language dataset chat interface using Groq with full conversation history, dataset context injection, and suggested question shortcuts.

• Trained on PaySim dataset (6.36M transactions, 0.129% fraud) using 5-fold stratified temporal validation to handle extreme imbalance.
• Engineered behavioral and transactional features including balance shifts, transaction velocity, cross-border mismatches, and IP anomaly signals.

System Design:
• Developed Flask REST APIs for real-time scoring and structured transaction storage in SQLite.
• Integrated LLaMA to generate contextual natural-language explanations for high-risk and cross-border transactions.
• Enriched transactions via IPInfo API for geolocation, VPN/proxy detection, and automated risk escalation logic.

• Replaced local Ollama inference with Groq-hosted LLaMA 3.1 for cloud deployment, bypassing LlamaIndex's LLM layer entirely to call Groq SDK directly.
• Designed auto-company detection logic that maps query keywords to source documents for targeted retrieval.

System Design:
• Built Google Drive-based index distribution: 4 vector store files (~150MB) auto-downloaded at app startup via gdown, eliminating GitHub file size constraints.
• Implemented source-level metadata filtering to restrict retrieval to specific filings per query.
• Managed full MLOps lifecycle: local Ollama prototyping → HuggingFace embeddings → Groq inference → Streamlit Cloud deployment.
